#Virtual Solar Sensors
Galvanize capstone project for predicting solar energy usage from sensors and satellite data

##Background and Motivation
From satellite imagery data from NOAA and real physical sensors from NREL, create virtual sensors for anyone in the United States to use - possibly for predicting the energy from a solar panel setup.

Virtual sensors also have potential applications in other fields such as Internet of Things (IoT) and GIS applications.

##Data
Using photometric spectroscopy data from Hawaii and corroborating that with aerosol satellite images, we can create virtual sensors that inform us how much solar can be produced in a given geographical location in the United States.

##Method
By using machine learning algorithms (such as neural networks and kmeans) on the data, we can reveal empirical trends in the data that let us reproduce the sensor data collected in Colorado and/or Hawaii.  Using this data in another location in the contenental United States, should allow one to predict the solar energy production.  This will be confirmed by using the virtual sensor information to build a virtual silicon-based solar panel model.  Futhermore, an approximate model of a residental solar system will be modelled.

##Web Interface
The web interface will allow one to set up a virtual resisdential solar system and simulate how much energy it would have made for a given amount of time.  Potentially it would also include pricing information such as selecting solar panels from different solar cell companies and comparing the cost and energy savings.
